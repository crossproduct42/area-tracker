TRACKER INSTRUCTIONS:

- Open AreaTracker.html in your browser
- Load a .json file found in the "packs" subfolder
- Use dropdown to select a zone
- Click endpoint of map line (ie the bottom of the lollipop) to set a door link
    - This will bring up a panel of all zones
    - Select zone icon for exit
    - Click square to link doors together
    - Notes on colors
        - BLACK: This is the current door. If you click this, you will link a door to itself.
        - GRAY: This door is already linked to another entrance.
        - RED: This door is the wrong type to link with the current door.
        - GREEN: This door is unassigned and correctly corresponds to current door.
        - GOLD BORDER: You cannot select this door. It is indicated "unchangeable" in the JSON
        - You can ignore colors (besides gold border) and link whatever doors you want. This is only a guide.
- Doors are now linked! You can now also navigate by clicking icons on the center map!
    - In full release, icons will branch out and show 2-3 transitions deep
    - In full release, navigation through main map will be animated!
    - Notes on lollipop sticks:
        - GREEN: Normal, 2-way transition
        - BLUE: One-way OUT. Creating a link from this door WILL NOT copy zone to the other side!
        - RED: One-way IN. Functions normally in the tracker, but specially marked so you don't stoop yourself!
        - GOLD BORDER: Unchangeable door. You can still use the icons to navigate the main map, though!
- Use the text area on the right to type any relevant info to help in your game!
    - Possible future support for default pack-specific text to go here
